<pre><code>/* I am a girl named mushroom.
   I am an architect. 
   Now I want to tell a story about a boy named KJlmfe. */


I met you in a driving lesson.
It seemed normal but changed my life. 

// You didn&#39;t talk much. 
// So did I. 
// Maybe you even did&#39;t notice me.

// But...

// I decided to make friends with you, 3 months after I first met you. 
// Although it was awkward for a girl to send messages initiatively.

/* Now I&#39;m still so proud of my bravery. */

// I eat more to be fatter because of you.
// I drink water everytime I miss you. Then I even want to throw up...
// I become a runner because of your hobby.
// I read Hackers and Painters bacause you love it.
// I learn much about coding. It&#39;s miracle that though I can&#39;t understand most of them I don&#39;t feel boring.
// I try everything to enter you programmers&#39; world.

/* So now, I&#39;m using a code forking from Github to give you a surprise! */


<b>Dear man, happy 21st birthday!</b>


And

<b><font color=red>I love you</font></b>

Thanks God I did not miss you.
